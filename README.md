Objective:

This project simulates an Electronic Nose (E-Nose) system that can analyze and classify various chemical odors using a web-based interface. It provides interactive features, visualization, machine learning-based classification, and speech output to enhance user experience. The project is designed to work in a mobile development environment using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features:
1. Chemical Odor Selection:
Users can select from a list of common chemicals (e.g., Hydrogen Sulfide, Ammonia, Acetic Acid, Benzene, Sulfur Dioxide, and Methane).

Each chemical is associated with a detailed odor description.

2. Odor Analysis and Display:
When a chemical is selected, the corresponding odor description is displayed.

Descriptions include information about the smell and common applications of each chemical.

3. Dynamic Visualization:
Visual feedback represents odor intensity using an animated circle.

The circle scales up and changes color to illustrate the intensity and nature of the odor.



4. Machine Learning Integration (Brain.js):

Basic odor classification is implemented using the Brain.js library.

The neural network classifies selected chemicals based on predefined odor profiles (e.g., unpleasant, pungent, sour, sweet, sharp, odorless).



5. Speech Output (Web Speech API):

The application uses the Web Speech API to read the odor description aloud.

This feature enhances accessibility for users with visual impairments.



6. Responsive Design:

The interface is designed to work smoothly on both desktop and mobile browsers.

Clean and intuitive user interface with CSS for styling.
